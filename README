Cygwin notes
======================
1. Dependency is on Gpg instead of GPG2
2. Changed command to gpg in the script.
3. --batch does not work - there's no agent. So you need to enter GPG password everytime
4. Cygwin does not have `tree` - download and compile from source from here http://lassauge.free.fr/cygwin/release/tree/
5. You will need a few cygwin packages (other than the ones in the original list)
    1. linux-utils (getopt)
    2. cygutils-extra (getclip/putclip)

Simple Password Store
by Jason Donenfeld

======================

This is a very simple password store that encrypts passwords using gpg and
places the encrypted password in a directory. It can generate new passwords
and keep track of old ones.

Please see the man page for documentation and examples.
